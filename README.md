### Hey, I'm Devin.

I'm a self-taught programmer from Northcentral Ohio, currently working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Franklin University.

When I'm not doing school work, I like to spend my free time learning and building things. Follow me on GitHub to see what I'm currently working on.
